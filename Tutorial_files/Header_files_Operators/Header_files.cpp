//There are two types of header files in c++.

/*
    1. System header files:- These files are already included with the compiler.

    2. User defined header files:- These files are created by the user.

    User defined header files can be imported like this:

    #include "fuck.h"  Sorry I have a broken Humor.....

    to learn more about other header files you can access "en.cppreference.com"

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
    int boo;
    int doo;

    cout<<"Enter the number you'd like to multiply with the other number: ";
    
    return 0;
}
