//This file will include what scope is?


/*
    Scope of a variable is the region in the code where the existence of variable is valid.
    "Simple explanation Scope of variable is the region where the variable is available in the codebase."

    based on scope we have two types of variables:-
    
        1. Local Variable: variables declared inside the braces of a function and can be accessed from there only.

        2. Global Variables:- These variables are declared outside any function and can be accessed from anywhere.
